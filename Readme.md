Object detection is a computer vision technique that enables machines to 
identify and locate objects within images or videos. It involves classification 
(what object is present) and localization (where the object is in the image). In 
this practical, we focus on car detection using object detection techniques. 
1. What is Object Detection? 
Object detection is a step beyond image classification. While classification 
tells us what object is present in an image, object detection tells us where it is 
located using bounding boxes.

 ️. Object Detection Techniques 
There are several techniques used in object detection, including: 
1. Traditional Methods (Before Deep Learning) 
2
 ️. Deep Learning-Based Methods (Modern Approach) 
3. YOLO (You Only Look Once) for Object Detection 
Car Detection as an Object Detection Task 
In this practical, we focus on Cars detection, where the goal is to: 
Detect different types of fruits in images or videos 
Draw bounding boxes around each car.
